## Instructions

If you wish to install this card to your server, then all files are here.
If you wish to host the card yourself, change "email.html" so it would link to files in your server.
In that file you need to change the following links:

* `href=""`
* `data-saferedirecturl=""`
* `src=""`

First two reference the url client will be redirected to.
The last one links the email image file.
